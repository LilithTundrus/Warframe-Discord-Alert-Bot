# Warframe-Discord-Alert-Bot

## About 

This is a bot for Discord written in Typescript using the Disocrd.js framework


## Running The Bot

**Note**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer as well as Typescript 2.7 or higher

If you want to run this yourself you'll need to do a couple things:

1. Clone this repo and `npm install` from the CLI
2. You will need to generate a `config.ts` file in the `/src` folder using the `config-template.ts` file found in `/src`
3. Then you compile the Typescript down to Javascript by typing `tsc` in the root directory of the project
4. `cd` to the `build` directory and type `node index.js`
